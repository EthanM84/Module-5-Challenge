  <h1>Cancer Treatment Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
    <ul>
      <li>Mouse ID: Unique identifier for each mouse</li>
      <li>Timepoint: Timepoint of measurement during the study</li>
      <li>Tumor Volume (mm3): Measured tumor volume in cubic millimeters</li>
      <li>Metastatic Sites: Number of metastatic sites observed</li>
      <li>Drug Regimen: Treatment regimen administered to the mouse</li>
      <li>Sex: Gender of the mouse</li>
      <li>Age_months: Age of the mouse in months</li>
      <li>Weight (g): Weight of the mouse in grams</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The project includes the following files:
    <ul>
      <li><code>data.csv</code>: The dataset file containing the raw data used for analysis.</li>
      <li><code>data_analysis.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.</li>
      <li><code>data_analysis.py</code>: Python script version of the data analysis code.</li>
      <li><code>README.md</code>: This file, providing an overview of the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the project repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-treatment-analysis.git</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd cancer-treatment-analysis</code></li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
    <li>Run the data analysis script: <code>python data_analysis.py</code></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed on your system.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis provides insights into the tumor response to different treatment regimens, including key metrics such
    as tumor volume, metastatic sites, and mouse characteristics. The analysis also includes visualizations such as box
    plots, scatter plots, and pie charts to aid in understanding the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In conclusion, this project aims to analyze the effectiveness of cancer treatment regimens using mouse models. The
    analysis provides valuable insights into the tumor response and helps evaluate the efficacy of different treatments.
    The generated visualizations aid in visualizing the data and understanding the patterns and trends. By leveraging
    the findings from this analysis, further research and improvements in cancer treatment can be explored.
